# Data-Analysis-for-a-sample-data

This project presents a data analysis of a sample data from a mobile game. The database comprises three tables, including account, account_date_session, and iap_purchase. The account table provides user profiles, while the iap_purchase table contains information about in-app purchases made by the users. On the other hand, the account_date_session table provides data on the number of sessions that users have played for a particular period.

The project aims to identify trends in revenue and daily active users through data visualization and explanation of the observations. In addition, the project investigates the lifetime value of the game players.
